Python tools developed over time.

## ExeScraper.py
  This was created to distinguish between 32- and 64-bit EXE files. Very handy when you can't easily get version data.
  Drop the file into the appropriate folder (you may need permissions) and run. If Python 3 is not in your system path,
  you may encounter issues.


## XMLFormatter.py
  This project began with my frustration at .Net Web Forms for destroying any structure you have built into your HTML. This
  got me thinking about how I could use regular expressions to format XML and its variants. Although it is not recommend
  that regular expressions be used for parsing XML, I had fun.
  
These files were written around 2016.
